# SortingVisualiser

A java program that visualises different sorting methods with a GUI.

# Bubble Sort
In bubble sort, the cursor (pink) loops through the unsorted array, obtains the largest number and places it at the end of the unsorted array.

# Selection Sort

In selection sort, the cursor (yellow) loops through the array, while a second cursor loops through the unsorted portion of the array and finds the smallest number (blue) before returning it to the end of the sorted part of the array.
